🚀 **New Project: Autonomous Perimeter Defense System - AI-Powered Zero Trust Threat Detection Platform**

Excited to share my latest defense industry project: an **Autonomous Perimeter Defense System (APDS)** that combines Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Zero Trust architecture for real-time threat detection and classification. This platform demonstrates hands-on experience with technologies and compliance standards used by defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, and Booz Allen Hamilton.

**🎯 Defense-Relevant Features:**

🤖 **AI-Powered Threat Detection**
- Real-time Computer Vision using YOLOv8 for object detection (person, vehicle classification)
- Machine Learning threat classification with explainable AI scoring
- Sub-100ms detection latency processing 200+ detections per minute
- Threat categories: benign, suspicious, high_threat, critical with feature-level attribution

🔐 **Zero Trust Architecture (NIST 800-53 Compliant)**
- JWT-based service authentication across 6+ microservices
- 100% authenticated inter-service communication with service account tokens
- Role-based access control (admin, operator, viewer, service roles)
- Token revocation and validation aligned to AC, IA control families

📊 **Real-Time Threat Monitoring Dashboard**
- Live detection and classification statistics
- Alert management with acknowledgment workflow
- System health monitoring across all microservices
- Threat score visualization and explainable AI rationale

🔒 **DevSecOps & Container Security**
- Automated CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Container security scanning using Trivy (zero Critical/High CVEs)
- Multi-stage Docker builds reducing attack surface by 70%
- Bandit static analysis and dependency vulnerability checks

📋 **NIST 800-53 Compliance Mapping**
- Mapped to 5 control families: AC, AU, IA, SC, SI
- Structured audit logging with PostgreSQL persistence
- FedRAMP High and DHS 4300A compliance-ready
- Tamper-evident storage and comprehensive event tracking

☸️ **Microservices Architecture**
- Containerized services: Auth, CV Detection, ML Classification, Alert, API Gateway
- Event-driven architecture with Redis message queues
- PostgreSQL for persistent threat and alert storage
- Kubernetes-ready with health checks and graceful degradation

**💡 This project demonstrates expertise in:**
✅ Zero Trust architecture implementation
