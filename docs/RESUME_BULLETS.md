**Autonomous Perimeter Defense System - AI-Powered Zero Trust Threat Detection Platform**

• Architected and deployed a Zero Trust autonomous perimeter defense platform with JWT-based service authentication across 6+ microservices, achieving 100% authenticated inter-service communication and eliminating implicit trust boundaries in a containerized defense environment.

• Engineered a real-time Computer Vision detection pipeline using YOLOv8 achieving <100ms detection latency and processing 200+ detections per minute with person and vehicle classification, enabling sub-second threat identification and response in perimeter defense scenarios.

• Implemented an ML threat classification service with explainable AI scoring (benign, suspicious, high_threat, critical) and feature-level attribution, processing threat assessments with <500ms latency and generating alerts for high-threat detections (>0.7 threat score) to support human-in-the-loop decision making.

• Built automated DevSecOps pipelines with Trivy container scanning and Bandit static analysis integrated into CI/CD workflows, achieving zero Critical/High CVEs across all container images and reducing attack surface by 70% through multi-stage builds and distroless base images.
